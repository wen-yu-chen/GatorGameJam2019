# GatorGameJam2019
2D scroll game at Gator Game Jam(Hackathon).
Worked in a team of 6.

The game is like Super Mario Bros. where the player controls the character to survive from attacks and to reach the goal.
Mainly responsible for developing the controller of the game that handles motions of the character as well as calculates gravity,
falling speed, walking/running speed on Unity
